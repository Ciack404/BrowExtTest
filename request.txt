* Goal:
- Build a Chrome plug-in that gives additional contextual information
about people (from a given database) found in webpages. The plugin
should, when activated, highlight / underline all references about
people name and, on mouseover on those names, display a pop-up with
the person biography and picture.

* People database:
- The JSON file attached to this e-mail

* Tools:
- Use any javascript extension / library that you want
- Use Chrome documentation, any forum, etc.
- You can ask me any question by e-mail or skype

* Objectives
- Show how quickly you can learn a new toolkit
- Show your coding skills in javascript / HTML / CSS
- Show how you consider design an user-experience in such a process
- Show that you can build a nice UI with HTML / JS / CSS only

* Deliverable
- The source code of the plugin (tgz)
- A text file (a few lines / bullet points) explaining the design
choices, and if you've been stuck during the process, how you solved
your issues / which websites you used for this, etc.

* Bonus
- Use the YouTube API to display a random video in addition to the
picture / biography
- Put the JSON file on a webserver and use AJAX calls to get the date
into the script
- Separate the biograph + picture from the video using tabs in the pop-up
- Whatever you consider as in improvement and that you want to include
(if so, explain why you've done the improvement in the document)

As discussed on the phone, it should not take too long once you see
how a plug-in works - feel free to e-mail me whenever you think the
result is acceptable enough.

Best of luck,

Alex.
