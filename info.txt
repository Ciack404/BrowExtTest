CHOICES:

1. browserAction VS pageAction
I thought that, being the extension activated onClick it's better to have its icon near the toolbar always visible (as suggested in http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/browserAction.html)

2. Single popup with 2 tabs VS 2 popups
I'm not sure about this one: I started making 2 popups because I misunderstood your request (I thought of 2 popups instead og 2 tabs).
I think 2 tabs will be better (see improvement 3)

3. Popups colors
I tried some ui-tooltip style and I found this one more fitting since I put a youtube videon in the popup (i had to modify the text color: the default ui-tooltip-youtube is unintelligible)

4. Call to youtube synchronous
Since it take some time to download the youtube feed (see improvement 1) qTip fail to fill the content section. I made the call synchronous so it'll wait the response (see improvement 4).

--------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEMS:

1. background.js VS contentscript.js
As asked in a mail I sent you. Solved searching in forums/sites and studying examples. Once i got that there weren't great problems.

2. Popup tab request misunderstood
I was too tired (it was past midnight). That was my fault.

3. qtip
It took me some time (not as much as problem 1) to understand how to make it work. I didn't used jQuery for more than a year. Watching the seevl extension helped a lot (as I said via skype using google inspect element and the source code in  /home/<user>/.config/chromium/Default/Extensions)

--------------------------------------------------------------
IMPROVEMENT:

1. Loading time
I think that since it took some time to download the youtube feed it would be better to show a "loading" or "working" popup

2. Popup colors
I thought of changing the popups style depending on the page background color when it's possible (keeping ui-tooltip-youtube as default)

3. 1 popup with 2 tab

4. async youtube request
Instead of loading all the popup at the beginning load them onmouseover. Loading them at the beginning make the loading slower (solvable with improvement 1), but faster during the UX.
With few artists (my scenario) it's better to download the feed at the beginning (avoiding multiple requests for the same artist).
With many artists it's better to load the popups one by one on mouse over

5. stop other extensions
I see that when my extension is activated other js stop working. That is a major issue.
